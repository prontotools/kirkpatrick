# Kirkpatrick

Kirkpatrick is a web-based application that helps us collect feedback and
evaluate the effectiveness of our training program in one place. This project
is named after [Donald
Kirkpatrick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Kirkpatrick), the best known
for creating a model for analyzing and evaluating the results of training
programs.
